Paging:
  I spent a lot of time on really dumb stuff, mostly tring to optimize things
  Also whenever I got a bug that I couldnt fix I would drop doing any
  work for a few days, and then I would notice that the bug was somethin
  real dumb like trying to free a reference to a memory location 
  rather than a memory location.
  I think we also merged too late, I found a bunch of paging bugs
  right before the presentation that I would of been able to fix if I had
  the time.
  I think if I had a week more I could get a lot more done, and basically
  this has been a lesson in get your work done before you optimize for me.
  Also look for stupid bugs before complicated ones
