=====

The functions for determining processor information, setting up SMP, and actually
booting application processors are contained within this file.

The main function in this file is initSMP(). This is the only function you should
call from outside the file. The headers don't enforce this restriction so you need
to be careful.


initSMP()
---------

This sets up and starts up all of the available cores on the CPU. When these
come online, the trampoline sets them up to run with the rest of the system and
holds them in a waiting state.
