Description
  First-fit memory allocator, before paging is enabled the allocator is inplace.
  Once paging is in place the memor is divided in chunks, chunks of 
  any size can be allocated, and page chuncks can also be allocated.

  the block manager has a linked list of free nodes so it can search quickly
  

  Allocate:
    Find the first free chunk, split it and allocate it.

  Deallocation:
    Mark the chunk as free, update the list
    see if any space can be dynamically reallocated to the 
    manager


functions:
  _sm_init(); returns the block of memory
  _sm_alloc(block manager, size, aligned)
  _sm_free(ptr, block manager ptr)
