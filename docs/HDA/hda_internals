  HDA Module Internals
=========================


PCI INTERFACE
=============

In order to interface with the ICH7 Intel High Definition Audio controller, Its PCI
configuration space registers must be accessible from the device driver. Using those
registers, the driver enables HDA interrupts, finds the location of the HDA memory-
mapped registers and stores it for later use.


HDA CONTROLLER
==============

The HDA Controller registers are memory mapped in 32-bit memory space at the address
discovered in the PCI configuration space. The driver allocates buffers for sending
stream and command data over the link to the codec(s).

Buffer Descriptor List: A contiguous block of 32 16-byte entries that describe each 
	data buffer in an audio stream. Can describe an input or an output stream.
	[64 bits Buffer addr.][32 bits buffer length] [32 bits Interrupt flag]


CORB / RIRB: Circular command buffers used to send command and response data to/from
	a codec. (Not used in leiu of Immediate Command and Response Registers)


CODEC INTERFACE
===============

The Codec Interface provides easy access to codec configuration using the Immediate
Command and Response Registers.

Immediate Command/Response: 3 memory mapped registers in the HDA Controller
		IC: Immediate Command takes the 32 bit payload of a codec command
		IR: Is populated with the 32 bit response of the codec
		IRS: Status flags that tell the software/codec that a response/command is available
