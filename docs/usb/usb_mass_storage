The current mass storage implementation is just a skeleton of what
would become the mass storage driver. Some of it is currently
psuedocode. It is meant to interface with a filesystem so it 
provides two main methods, usb_ms_read and usb_ms_write, which would
allow a filesystem to write or read a buffer of a certain length from
a location on the specified disk. Right now it merely sets up the
structures that are required to make this transaction. In the 
future the id field which is passed in will probably be replaced by
a structure or more complicate data structure which represents
a location and disk to write to.
